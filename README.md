 ## Project Description 
    Weather time is a simple weather app that will find the humidity, temperature, and other useful weather information by a City search.  It is currently themed for a rainy day but in further development the background would reflect the weather of the given city.  It includes the current weather forecast pulled from the Open Weather API and also provides a 5 day forecast .

## Notes from project build:

    August 18, 2020

    I started this homework by watching video that walks you through the AJAX function with Open Weather.  I was able to get the AJAX function to retrieve the inforamtion with my key and push it to the screen.  I have figured out how to get the 5 day forecast by indentifying the date and location within the array that is sent back by Open Weather.  I will need to format the responses into different days and identify all the elemnts that are needed.

    I am using the on click function to grab the input search and list it on the screen.  I am not understanding how to recall the search historhy if I reload the page, the items are erased.  


    August 19, 2020

    I struggled a lot with finding the ID for the function pull but managed to get it working.

    Fixed the third Ajax function.

    I also fixed the 5 day forecast adding each element (date, icon, temp, humidity).  Now I need to replicat the initial load when the "submit" button is hit. 

    I am still struggling with this assignment particularly the "submit" buttons that are generated are not reactive and I am not entirely sure why.  

    Two functionality issues - links for search buttons dont work for newly entered submits (previous loads work) and push to storage erases past searches.**
